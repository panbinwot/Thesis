# Thesis
This is thesis for QMSS. 
My topic is predicting salaries with machine learning models. <br/>
The data is collected from NLSY97 and cleaned in Stata. Models are defined in Python (sklearn and keras). In this paper, I try to address the following three quesitons.
- How best canwe predict wages with all the methods we have given those legit variables? 
- Is itgetting hard to predict wages ?  
- Is neural net way too powerful for social science research?
